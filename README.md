Literally everlasting birthday card using Arduino.

## Abstract

Everyone received those cute birthday cards on their birthday, right?
You read them with shining eyes and smile, then put it to your drawer or box for memories and barely read again.

But, what if you would have a cool handcrafted gift card which congratulates you with your birthday every year,
provides you a candle to blow and also displays a unique birthday wish for this year?
Well, this is what I have developed.
I also should mention, that part of the idea is from [here](https://github.com/MakeItHackin/BirthdayCard).

### Features

* While waiting for your birthday, you can turn the card on and see number of days, hours, minutes and seconds left to
  the
  birthday. If you press and hold button, current date, time and temperature will be displayed. Some cool songs from
  Undertale will also be playing.
* The card will wish you a happy birthday if you turn it on the birthday date! It will play the Happy Birthday song and
  offer you to blow a candle. Then it will show you a unique wish for this birthday date (they are stored in the FLASH
  memory).
* You can store at least up to 7 wishes (7 wishes = 7 years) of length around 150 symbols. This capacity can be
  increased if some songs will be removed or the code will be optimized.
